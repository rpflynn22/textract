Textract
========

An android application to analyze the sentiment of your text messages.

Allows users to view a list of their SMS conversations and sentiment statistics about those conversations, including overall sentiment, sentiment of sent messages, and sentiment of incoming messages.

If the sent message sentiment is low enough, the application will generate an apology text to your contact, which the user may or may not choose to send (mostly exists for entertainment purposes).

The application is currently published on the Google Play store at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.messagefeeling.Textract
